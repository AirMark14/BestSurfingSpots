https://www.yelp.com/biz/huntington-beach-huntington-beach,Huntington Beach,5,"Huntington Beach can be a little crowded at times, but I love coming here when I am Orange County. I love the beach culture and the vibes here. I don't surf, but I like to ride my longboard on the boardwalk and float on my boogie board. Huntington Breach is a 10 mile long stretch of sandy beaches and is nicknamed ""Surf City"". Newport Beach is just south of this area. One of the world's largest surf competition called The US Open of Surfing takes place here in the summer. 

The waves can be a little stronge at times, but I love it. I love the workout fighting the waves and have caught some good ones on my boogie board. I like to walk on the pier and watch all of the other surfers on their boards and the sunset. Downtown Huntington Beach is pretty cool. There are lots of places to shop and eat at. I will usually pick up a few items at a surf shop and then grab some Wahoo's after a long day at the beach. They have an Artisan Fair on Fridays and occasional weekends where you can pick up some local artwork. Parking isn't too bad on the weekdays if you get here early enough. Weekends can be more challenging. 

Huntington Beach is home to the Huntington Beach International Surfing Museum. There is lots of memorabilia here if you enjoy surf history.","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Z_N65OXUysRruflr8_898w/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5q0c4sSavM7on92TpMCd_Q/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OOYN5s_rQbauHDEy857y3w/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/asSuVC594cnm7WHncqpBoQ/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rdHAMqlwekywCf0wrB3ODg/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/naZImSUXGNDolTZLArWyHA/348s.jpg",04/13/2024 21:53:12,1713045192,FfuYvUvnpd6URJrPx_kfWg,Travis T.,509,11273,1417,"Chandler, AZ",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/PyNg-SMvUgtGm9ndhHYE7w/180s.jpg,XPZVfP7DQCSL3Nb9t2vxsA,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=XPZVfP7DQCSL3Nb9t2vxsA,,,,,,8,2,7,0

Vibes: Depends on the day you go and the time, the crowd can vary significantly but these last two times I've gone during the summer evenings It's been great vibes. 

Experience: Going with a group of friends and hanging near the fire pits has been a highlight of the summer season so far. Staking out a pit can be a bit of a waiting game but if you go at the right time, early evening during the week it's no issue. Even on a holiday weekend, you can wait on a group to leave and you'll be fine. The pits are spaced out enough for a group to do their own thing and have their music playing. Beach closes at 10pm and the security is pretty on it. No complaints though. I'm not too sure about the pier, promenade, or other parts of the beach since I mostly stayed near the pits but I recommend it to anyone.","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Zkt_EaUNU-zaxGNuXiN-ew/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Kf3ElgNU81yFZj5_41oNNg/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v238OwT-A8yEzmG0ml47Xw/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XnaSM5QXyARiFndn9FUOlw/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BRpIfR7not5W2cCJNJG_1g/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EyL7Uwnvi3M-FLREW5TQEg/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5JZV_XEqRgr0OJUJWNo9Vw/348s.jpg",07/20/2023 01:49:05,1689817745,bHSqoqPLlkfl6CvJtC3e7Q,Lyna K.,37,364,114,"Los Angeles, CA",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/fEppceeHYri8uAIkIwzRPQ/180s.jpg,IWVLQkycvtbPnIPE0nongQ,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=IWVLQkycvtbPnIPE0nongQ,,,,,,2,0,0,0

it was oddly PACKED and many parking lots were full. we finally spotted street parking and were able to take it just in time. 2 hours was about $7, not too bad. we were super confused as to why it was so busy and before we knew it we were in the middle of an air show! the pacific air show?? I had no idea it was going on so it was a huge surprise and success for an outing!
now we understood why it was so packed. 
even with how packed it was, we enjoyed ourselves. they had emergency vehicle ""roads"" marked out on the sand with caution tape, which made us feel extremely safe. pretty organized event. which there would have been more table and chairs around for my parents, we ended up having to leave before the air show ended because they were hungry but they didn't want to stand up and eat at the food trucks or the little food stands that were around. 

this is actually the second time I have randomly gone to huntington beach to find myself in the middle of the pacific air show. it was super cool and hope to one day be able to experience the entire thing, beginning to end!

As for the beaches and streets, they were pretty clean. enough police around to feel safe but not entirely overwhelmed. wish I could have taken my mom to feel the ice cold pacific water but too many people around and the way the waves had been hitting the sand, it was like a huge DIP before getting to any water.",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mNc_XKTFlrydvxLd9ZZtYQ/348s.jpg,10/01/2023 02:11:13,1696126273,VfKs0Cf7FPoT1uIUCVt6dQ,Ursina O.,66,81,150,"Lake Elsinore, CA",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/XiT6OQko8TkxaoFuzyXjBg/180s.jpg,eQv77Qjh1ia4kNYgtp8y5A,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eQv77Qjh1ia4kNYgtp8y5A,,,,,,2,0,0,0

The day started by relaxing on the beach, surrounded by miles of picturesque blue Pacific Ocean waters. The sun shone brightly, and the waves provided a calming musical accompaniment. The beach was the perfect place to indulge in activities such as sunbathing, swimming, surfing, and volleyball. As the day progressed, the beachgoers indulged in a variety of activities such as beachcombing, kite flying, and enjoying the beach's local wildlife.

In the afternoon, the beach was host to a number of events, including a beach bonfire, fireworks show, and a beach barbeque. Beachgoers were also able to enjoy music and entertainment provided by local vendors. The evening was filled with laughter and camaraderie, and it was the perfect way to end a perfect day.

After a full day of activities and entertainment, many of the beachgoers enjoyed a delicious dinner at one of the many restaurants located along the pier. The quality of the food was second to none, and it was the perfect way to cap off a full day experience at Huntington Beach.

In conclusion, a full day experience at Huntington Beach is one that will not be soon forgotten.

Life and livelihoods were destroyed by all this Fear mongering. This new variant omicron was discovered by the chair of the SouthAfrican Medical Association, Dr AngeliqueCoetzee. Here's how she describes the threat:  Looking at the mildness of the symptoms that we are seeing, currently, there's no reason for panicking as we don't see severely ill patients. 
Its gunna be good....for business !
""Product sales from its coronavirus vaccine accounted for $4.81 billion of Moderna's $4.97 billion in revenue in the third quarter.""
you should not extrapolate how this variant will effect the entire population based on the opinion of the CEO for the company that stands to make billions more on booster shots for this variant. I would actually listen to Dr Coetzee that has been treating patients over the CEO who has a vested interest in extending profits for stockholders.
Viruses sometimes mutate to a less virulent strain. 
Stop with the gloom and doom.  All these articles are causing unnecessary mental illness of fear, anxiety, paranoia. So the company with over 90 percent of its revenue from covidvaccines says we need another vaccine variant to combat the new strain? It's heartbreaking to see all empty stores in my beloved hometown, these stores will never come back until Brandon is gone, I miss the vibrant city that is called Surf City.

The weather is always nice. Everyone from the IE & LA flocks here rain or shine. We are a community of singles, families and young families. Safe to say all locals are all dog lovers. 
Our beaches are clean and we want to keep them that way. So anything you bring (bbq, cooler, couch, umbrella, cigarettes, cans, trash, dog poop, etc) please take back with you or use the proper trash reciprocals. Don't leave it in the sand. It makes for eye sores and really pisses us locals off.
Parking is easy and plenty. Unless you go to dog beach. Those parking lots are small and few. Parking comes at a cost. Both state and city beaches. $15-$20 all day, cash only. 
If you are going to take your bike like your motorized bike. Be aware children and dogs will jump out in front of you. Go the speed limit and don't be a dick on the bikes.

 We were up here for the WSA contest for all ages in different Heats.
My son was an active Pro Surfer in school and won many trophies.
At age 46 he thought he'd start again.
He is very healthy and athletic an wanted to do something that he loved so much 20 years ago.
He signed up for three Heats and walked out with two trophies coming in 5th place.
There are only trophies for up to 6th Place and a lot of competitors and a lot of competitors way younger
KUDO'S my joy!
The waves were terrible as in lots of foam, quick breaking and barely three feet.
I'm not making excuses, it was what it was. I spoke to different Surfers on the beach no one was happy about the waves.
The weather was cloudy, cold and windy most of the day until after 2.

This beach is HUGE and there is a parking lot big enough to accommodate the influx of people coming and going. $15 to park in the lot for the whole day, not bad imo. I have to say I love that the bike path here is big and wide so if you're riding along, you're not all cramped bumping into people or trying to avoid hitting them. Didn't rent bikes this time, but plan to next time. The fire pits are a nice touch to end your beach day. Don't forget your lighter fluid and smores stuff!
For the most part, it seems clean and people were social distancing within their groups. It's OC, so I didn't see a lot of people wearing masks. The bathrooms are nasty af plain and simple. I strongly advise you to hold your breath for as long as you can while you go unless you're able to stomach the stench. Every stall is disgusting and idk why but all the seats I saw were wet as if the guys just don't aim and pee all over them on purpose. WTF?! I didn't see any sinks to wash your hands so your best bet is to maybe use the showers they have to rinse your hands off. If you're a lady, bring wipes...LOTS of them and stuff them in your top so you can try to avoid touching the door when you're done handling your biz. There are paper towel holders but always empty. Hand sanitizer is always a plus! 
I didn't bring anything to eat, just drinks, so I walked over to the concession stand by the bathrooms and ordered chicken strips and a tuna sandwich. The girl was nice enough to accommodate my keto lifestyle by offering a lettuce wrapped sandwich when I asked if they could make it open faced. Yay! That was nice of her.

Huntington beach is famous and it's known as one of the best surfing beaches.

But, it's way more than that. You can view almost anything along this beach on and off it. Freaks and geeks. Athletes and artists. Musicians and jugglers. Shopping, eateries, and locals joints. Bars and hotels. All kinds of people watching and entertainment.

Plenty of parking all around for a daily fee.

You can even set up you BBQ here on the beach and have a giant tailgate party. We saw so many ""tent cities"" set up and some were pretty elaborate. The beach scene here on the weekends is such a part of the local community life, and it looks like they live for it when Friday rolls around.

HB is known as ""Surf City"".  Here you'll find many camping out in their trailers, fishing on the pier, swimming, biking, exercising and other beach activities.  At dusk, many gather out here for bonfires.  It's gets super crowded during the summer months because more tourists visit the area. 

You can park at one of the lots off PCH.  I prefer to utilize the metered parking along the street.  I LOVE HB and come here a few times a month!!

HB in my humble opinion is more laid back, more casual and not too many fancy restaurants like NB.  Also, NB is old money, so houses are mammoth over there.  Here in HB, it's mostly businesses and surprisingly, quite a few chains like Starbucks, The Coffee Bean and even BJ.  The main action is right on Main Street (about 4 blocks), and every Tuesday from 5-9pm, they have Tacos Tuesday and Farmer's Market.  The nice part is that most restaurants do offer outdoor seating (with heater) which is great for us pet owners so they could dine with us too!  In terms of beach and view, I much prefer Venice Beach or Malibu.  There is much more excitement there, but if you prefer to just chill, this might be an optional spot for you.

1. Longer walk from the parking lot to the water- lots of sand!
2. The waves are stronger
3. The water is saltier
4. The food is more expensive ($6 for a small bag of dipping dots!)
5. That sun is stronger
6. Single individual room bathrooms make for tighter changing quarters and stinkier!
7. Super cool that the back of the beach is lined with fire pits!


With it being a Friday in July I was anticipating a lot more people.  There were people.  My friends set a table near a fire pit early in the morning so at 6ish we moved from water front to fire pit.  We spent the whole day at the beach! It was really cool at night when every fire pit was occupied, people were making friends between groups but you also had your own private party happening at each fire pit.  I loved this!  Overall, a great place to boogie board and have dinner on the fire!

Which is what I dont like about it during the summer, just way too many people. It's a massive beach with tons of room and firepits...... except for the summer time. Plan on getting here by 6-7am to reserve a pit or you won't get one at all. 

With that said, It's a nice beach and great for people watching and there's lots of amenities, you can rent everything from umbrellas to bikes and surfboards. If you dont mind the people, then this place is great.

I prefer coming here to do bonfires in the winter! Sure it's cold, but its never crowded, plenty of fire pits, no drama. The police are chill and aren't trying to immediately kick you off the beach as soon as its ten. Also you'll have enough time to actually enjoy a bonfire. During the summer it starts getting dark at like 8pm.... so you have like 2 hours to burn your wood. Bring a jacket.... cause it gets cold unless you've got a big fire.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/huntington-beach-huntington-beach,Huntington Beach,4,"Huntington Beach is open until 10 pm every night. During June/July the longest days of the year it is light until 8.30ish the max.

It cost 15 a day to park at the beach.  They use this money to clean the beach and restrooms and lifeguard salaries.  So if you look at it that way, it is not so bad.

If you get hungry, they have a 4 block restaurant bar district, Main Street,  which has all kinds of food.  Its expensive because rents in this area are extreme.   They have to make most of their money during summer months. 

Don't worry that they don't allow alcohol on the beach, there are tons of open air bars on main street to drink the day and night away away with shirtless guys and bikini clad women spring break style.  This way if the alcohol helps you to meet someone for the night, there are no surprises when you get back home like when you forget to check your eggs at Ralphs.

And if you are married or attached, just ask them to use those special sun glasses that puts clothing on anyone with a swimsuit and you will not get whiplash. 

There are no pets or smoking allowed on the beach.  The pit fires they allow on the beach make enough smoke to fumigate and kill you.

Nudity is no longer permitted on the beach but feel free to bring your thong if you like attention.

It costs 30 to 35 to rent a bike daily.  The bike path goes on forever and ever in both directions.   Its nice. 

HB is a fun place.  Its the epicenter of beach life in So Cal so check it out.  Get a tee shirt that says ""I survived a day at HB"" to show the non-adventourous relatives and friends.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/huntington-beach-huntington-beach,Huntington Beach,4,I always come to this beach with my family! We don't like staying next to the pier cause it's to crowded. I did go with my friends close to the pier and it was a bit crowded. Someone told me this place is rocky didn't believe it till my next visit it sure is. The waves are more dangerous in California then Florida. The water is super cold in California. This time I saw a sea lion come close to me & my brother & I got scared so I got out of the water. I heard if a sea lion is coming this close to shore that means it's running from something and I did see some finns after it. In 2017 it did report that more sharks were coming close to shore in California.

It's great to walk along the beach from 1 end of the beach to the other end. The Over 1 & 1/2 hour walk is beautiful & with a set of headphones & music the time goes by very quickly. Before you know it you've passed the pier and are at 1 end & getting ready to head back in the other direction. This is great for beach goers but especially those who hate to exercise; the scenery makes it easy to do!  
This spot is very popular for Boogie boarders, surfers, kite surfers, & volleyball players & swimmers. This beach has wide white sandy beaches & a separate large path for  bikes, roller skaters, skateboarders & surreys. They even have Fire Pits but you got to get there very early. Parking is $15 but there are meters on the street also.  You can bring your own cooler or there are lots of places to eat across from The Pier & the adjacent Pacific City

It's on PCH and Main St in Huntington Beach. 

Huntington beach is a lot bigger than its nearby beaches. I like this beach best because it's so easy and convenient (a less hasstle) to do anything unlike nearby beaches - easy to find a parking spot, you can do all kinds of activities here, and laid back and very ""California beach"" atmosphere.

Parking: You can find a spot (free!) in residential area, though you might need to walk a few blocks during the summer time and on weekends. Lots of meter parking along PCH. City parking by the beach is $15 for the day. The annual parking pass for $200. It's way easier to find a spot than ""Newport Beach"" and other beaches in the south. 

Surf: Yes. Very territorial locals, so be careful. 
Bike lane: Yes. Good beach biking ;)
Beach volley coats: Lots 
Bathroom: Yes
Showers: Yes
Surfing lesson: Yes (over 5 yrs old)
Rental bikes: Yes
Scuba: No. The water isn't so clear for diving. 
Sea creatures: Dolphins sometimes.
Eateries on beach: Quick grab to ""Duke's"". 
Events: Lots - US Open (surfing), X-games, July 4th etc. I like their farmer's market on Main St - every Tuesday evening - fresh produce, restaurants, art & craft etc. 
Pier: You can eat at ""Ruby's"" (at the end of pier). 

Main St: Lots of surf shops, ice cream, big chain restaurants (some small ones), clothing stores, souvenier shops, and cafe. Most foods aren't good here (Welcome to HB ;p - except for ""North Shore Poke Co"" and ""La Rocco's Pizzeria"". Both of them are located OFF Main St!!).

I've been coming to California almost every week for a year and my goal was to see the Pacific Ocean. Finally! I finally stuck my foot in the Cali water three weeks ago (end of May 2017). 

I had the best time here. We went to Fred's across the street. The group had enchiladas and I had some guacamole, chips and a Heineken. After that, it was la playa. Youth Surf Competition was on deck, families, singles, adults, kids, everyone having fun from boogie boarding or volleyball. 

Then, I found my tribe. I wasn't looking for it but there they were. I'm from the East so this was a huge treat for me to look over and see a group forming and hitting djembes and all types of drums. I jumped right in. One of the players (Juan) had two extra drum instruments and he said I could play them so I spent three hours switching between the two drums playing with these great people. From boardwalk dancers to hoola hooping everyone was getting in on this musical interaction. The one local guy said they do this every Sunday. Bystanders were cheering and clapping. It was really nice to find this 3,000 miles away from home. A group of 30-50 fellow drummers. It was majestic.","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5u-9duuw4lmvKx9JA9FDYw/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iB8BkqPMJtXTftw1tdqGEw/348s.jpg, https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5ucNiBxgylq2OQ0gOmLTFw/348s.jpg",06/13/2017 02:18:09,1497320289,eQgn6OMgMuM9rlFfiabUOQ,Keri O.,46,612,178,"Greenville, SC",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/afgTIdgfQGSShnv3ArBbMA/180s.jpg,_QPoL66NPjVVwymAW8sVLQ,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_QPoL66NPjVVwymAW8sVLQ,,,,,,0,0,1,0
https://www.yelp.com/biz/huntington-beach-huntington-beach,Huntington Beach,5,"The best beach in Orange County! 

I have been coming here since I was a kid. In grade school we would take the bus down Beach Blvd. with our boards. I still come here. My favorite spots are the North side of the pier and over by Lifeguard Tower 8. Even if there are no waves, you can almost always find a decent place to body surf between this stretch. 

People here are generally nice on the sand. Just to the north of the pier are where most of the high school and college kids go. It is pretty fun during the summer. But, it can get annoying if there are people in the water that should not be surfing. If you walk two lifeguard towers further North, it is more suitable for families and children. 

The South-side of the pier seems like an endless stretch of sand. It is great for taking long walks to think and meditate and great for running. 

Hawaii does have great beaches and surf. Cancun has awesome sand and water. But, I do not live anywhere near them and this place is always easily accessible. 

I have to say that watching the sunset here during Summer is 5 stars all on its own! 

Well, tomorrow is the 4th. I can tell you a story or two but will refrain. 
Just be prepared for a crowd at the beach if you are here for the 4th of July and an absolute party on the streets. I actually kind of stay away from here on the 4th, as the crowd has a lot of people from other places. Especially in the water I see people swimming with jeans and belts on. Isn't this dangerous? Maybe they even where shoes. I never understood the concept of wearing jeans in the ocean. There are these things called trunks.

Parking is easy. PCH is lined with meters and you can park for a fee by the pier. There is also a great deal of parking on the side streets.

Apparently, there was some corporate party that did the d-bag move of reserving most of the parking at the beach.  As I was driving around to find any sort of parking around the area, I look at the reserved lots and saw that they were empty.  Maybe a handful of cars were in a lot where hundreds of cars could have parked.  This alone actually ended up leading to me making the decision to skip out on my friend's bonfire.  And it wasn't worth the $15 parking fee when they told me this past 7pm.

I'll still give it 3 stars because it's a nice beach.

It's pretty clean, not too many weirdos around and although it's loaded with surfers (do to pretty nice waves) there are still plenty of family friendly groups and areas. Everyone seems pretty nice there and I find most people to be respectful of each other's space. Parking is $15 bucks near tower 17 but I like that area.

Aside from it being Surf City USA, the home to world surf comps and just a surfers paradise in general, Huntington is family friendly and even dog friendly ( way south of the pier) there is no shortage of things to do here. The beach has fire rings which are found off of PCH1 and Twin Dolphin and if you and your family are interested in a game of volley ball well, there are plenty of nets provided too. 
The beach goes on for miles so a walk is always a must. 
My favorite addition to Huntington has to be the Paséa Hotel with its Tanner's Treehouse Lounge this property  is a MUST! The place Gorgeous times 100! But that's an entirely different review....
