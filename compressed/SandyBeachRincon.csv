It was about a two hour drive on a Friday. I had researched a few Rincon beaches to check out and Sandy Beach was one of them.  It's not advertised with signage on the road so it was hard to find.  Small parking lot, no one around.  There are houses on the beach so those occupants were around, but that's it. We were approached by a couple guys selling homemade lava cakes, which we bought for $5 each and then were stopped by a guy who ran out of gas and needed money, so we gave him some.  At this point, we took some pics on the beach, drank a few beers then moved on.  I wouldn't waste my time stopping.  We found the downtown public beach had more facilities, a restaurant and not do desolate.

It was about a two hour drive on a Friday. I had researched a few Rincon beaches to check out and Sandy Beach was one of them.  It's not advertised with signage on the road so it was hard to find.  Small parking lot, no one around.  There are houses on the beach so those occupants were around, but that's it. We were approached by a couple guys selling homemade lava cakes, which we bought for $5 each and then were stopped by a guy who ran out of gas and needed money, so we gave him some.  At this point, we took some pics on the beach, drank a few beers then moved on.  I wouldn't waste my time stopping.  We found the downtown public beach had more facilities, a restaurant and not do desolate.
