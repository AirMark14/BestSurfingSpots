Or even 5...<br /><br />So as a non surfer what was Bells Beach like? Well it is nice to see a place that's famous even if in a sphere you don't normally swim in. But for the non surfer the appeal is that it's quite an interesting little cove and beach. It's darn near perfect in shape with cliffs surrounding in. There are multiple lookouts there where you can get good views and watch the surfers do their thing. <br /><br />There is a reasonable amount of parking and facilities and you can include checking the place out in between checking out Jan Juc Beach and Bird Rock Lookout. So even if you aren't a surfer this is still a worthwhile piece of coastline to check out.,Written 25 September 2023,1695600000,Paul L,4,,,

Is a bit rocky, and was quite onshore. I was surprised that at bells, there's literally just a beach! No shops, pub, nothing.

We were lucky enough to visit on a day with onshore winds that really whipped up the surf. This only added to the experience.

It was cold and foggy but the fog was not thick.<br /><br />I pulled over as soon as I saw a sign saying Bell's Beach. The car park was of a decent size and there were not many cars there. A sign by a path indicated a 10 minute walk to Bell's Beach.<br /><br />The path along the cliff top was quite chilly. I was wearing a beanie and a hooded jacket. I'm not one who feels the cold terribly but I needed to pull the hood over my beanie.<br /><br />At the end of the path there was another, larger car park, with more cars parked and a crowd of people lining the fence. That was the Bell's Beach/Winki Pop car park.<br /><br />The car park and viewing area is at the top of the cliff over looking the beach. There were somewhere between 20 to 30 surfers in the water. I had stopped 3 times at other beaches on the way and this was by far the most surfers I had seen. The surf looked pretty good.<br /><br />I did not venture down to the beach itself. I took a couple of pictures from the lookout and returned back down the path to my car. I had many places to visit that day.",Written 29 July 2021,1627516800,gregs3071,4,,,
