To get there you can take a bus from Guarullos airport in the Litoralenha stand just outside the airport or rent a car. Remember the roads in Brazil are not aesy to ride because of the morros and thats why it takes 4 hours to get there. The town is quiet during the week and on thursdays you can begin to see the sao pablo citizens getting there for the weekend. This is great because during the week most restaurant and stores close al 8 pm. The beach is huge and beautifull.,Written 15 March 2016,1458000000,MarceLZK,5,,,

When pulled into the ocean by a rip time be sure NOT to swim back against the current, but instead to swim paralel to the beach in order to escape from the gripe of the current. This is a wonderful beach but being that it is not flat it is not a good place for walks.  For children I recommend Praia da Baleia or Juquehy.",Written 24 January 2017,1485216000,Cedar32,4,,,

To get there you can take a bus from Guarullos airport in the Litoralenha stand just outside the airport or rent a car. Remember the roads in Brazil are not aesy to ride because of the morros and thats why it takes 4 hours to get there. The town is quiet during the week and on thursdays you can begin to see the sao pablo citizens getting there for the weekend. This is great because during the week most restaurant and stores close al 8 pm. The beach is huge and beautifull.,Written 15 March 2016,1458000000,MarceLZK,5,,,
