It's just far enough to avoid huge crowds in a heat wave (we went on a 95F+ day), and it is a dramatic, beautiful beach with great waves and small waves alike, pristine sand.  Only downside is there are no public restrooms (contrary to what some beach review sites say).  Highly recommend!  ",Written 4 August 2022,1659571200,epbwh,5,,,
