Long stretch of beach and an amazing ocean bath and pools. Paved so you can walk on a path or better if you want to walk along the sand or along the water. Great place for families and the ocean baths have lots of spaces suitable for toddlers, little kids, youth and adult. Such a nice atmosphere and lovely cafe with good food selection and coffee. Can sit and enjoy the views all day here.",Written 7 October 2020,1602028800,MosesPH,5,"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/23/0a/dc/you-can-even-swim-laps.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/23/0a/db/huge-ocean-bath.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/23/0a/da/ocean-baths.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/23/0a/d9/ocean-view.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/23/0a/ce/merewether-beach.jpg",,
