His media career started as a disc jockey at Radio Luxembourg in 1958 and on Tyne Tees Television in 1960, and he developed a reputation for eccentricity and flamboyance. At the BBC, he presented the first edition of Top of the Pops in 1964 and broadcast on Radio 1 from 1968. From 1975 until 1994, he presented Jim'll Fix It, an early Saturday evening television programme in which he arranged for the wishes of viewers, mainly children, to come true. During his lifetime, he was known for fund-raising and supporting charities and hospitals, in particular Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire. In 2009, he was described by The Guardian as a ""prodigious philanthropist""[10] and was honoured for his charity work.[11] He was awarded the OBE in 1971 and was knighted in 1990. In 2006 he introduced the last edition of Top of the Pops.",Written 15 November 2019,1573776000,Josh Warren,5,,,

Here at Supertubes, the land rises more sharply from the shore, affording an absolutely stunning view of the surfers catching the break,with the whole wide sweep of the bay visible on clear days. Dophin and whale sightings are commonplace from this vantage point too. <br />Although tiered benches have been provided at different points along the boardwalk, there are no ablution facilites at all. The other downside is that parking is limited, very limited, so plan accordingly!",Written 24 September 2014,1411516800,Jill d,4,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/9e/c2/7f/supertubes.jpg,,
