This beach one of the location in Alas purwo national part, the also have savana and other beaches that you could visit using your own car.<br />For the GLand its selves it still require 15 minutes to another gate where you park the car and report to jungle ranger your id and plan. And then you talk to Pak Komar as a coordinator to arrange your transportation to GLand (plengkung beach). You need to pay 250.000 idr for a car and a driver to drive and pick up for the return, they only have 6 cars where you need to wait until they retun from dropping other visitors. It takes 45mnts to arrive at the plengkung beach or you could walk for about 10km, i've seen some teenagers in group walking through the forrest.<br />Don,t complain about the road condition since the goverment will try to keep the part remain the same including the whole ecosystem from human interference.<br />Some advice : dont expect too much for the beach , it's not for kids or family visit, mostly for surfers. And ask the driver's mobile number  you need it to ensure when he will come back to pick you up.<br />There are some surfers camp you could rent for 450rb/person/night or 100$/Overseastourist/night.<br />Only mobile provider tel*omsel can reach this location :(",Written 18 May 2015,1431907200,Rey Pahlevi,3,,,
