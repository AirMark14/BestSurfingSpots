The Pipeline has two personalities so to speak. During the summer, the area is calm and is an ideal spot for swimming, snorkeling and relaxing on the beach.  However, during the winter months its waves are enormous and dangerous for the novice surfer. The waves sometimes reach 30 feet.  Several professional surfing competitions are held here in the winter months. We visited the end of March but did not see any huge swells.  The pipeline is the “Holy Grail” of riding the waves.  One of the waves is featured at the beginning of the Hawaii-Five-O television program. Surfing here is ot for the amateur so leave it to the professionals. Many surfers have lost their lives or suffered injuries when attempting to ride the pipeline waves.","Written May 17, 2022",1652745600,ITRT,4,"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/23/6b/cd/71/banzai-pipeline-ehukai.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/23/6b/cd/70/banzai-pipeline-ehukai.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/23/6b/cd/6f/banzai-pipeline-ehukai.jpg",,

The waves are huge, and they are known to attract surfers from all over. It is an incredible experience to sit on the beach and watch the pool of adept surfers riding enormous waves one after the other. The beach is reasonably crowded, although I'd say it is less so compared to a lot of other beaches on the island of Oahu. I found the beach to be very clean and the waters to be abundantly clear. It was a great sight to watch the sunset at this beach. One could sit here for hours on and watch the waves and the surfers!

During the Winter, Pipeline breaks out the best surf in the world.  The waves are not big at the Pipe (about 10 feet, but can get to about 20 feet).

I have lost two good friends at the Pipe, when it was breaking; and they were relatively good surfers.

During the Winter, Pipeline breaks out the best surf in the world.  The waves are not big at the Pipe (about 10 feet, but can get to about 20 feet).  BUT it is probably the most dangerous, because the waves break in shallow waters, where if one falls of the board in the wrong way, then you will meet your maker (by slamming into the shallow reefs). I have lost two good friends at the Pipe, when it was breaking; and they were relatively good surfers.

The waves are huge, and they are known to attract surfers from all over. It is an incredible experience to sit on the beach and watch the pool of adept surfers riding enormous waves one after the other. The beach is reasonably crowded, although I'd say it is less so compared to a lot of other beaches on the island of Oahu. I found the beach to be very clean and the waters to be abundantly clear. It was a great sight to watch the sunset at this beach. One could sit here for hours on and watch the waves and the surfers! It was a little tough to find parking when we got here on a weekend evening, a little bit before sunset - so be prepared to drive a little in order to find a parking spot.","Written January 2, 2021",1609545600,Nostalgiyeah,5,"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/7c/1e/c2/banzai-pipeline-beach.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/7c/1e/be/a-view-of-the-beach.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/7c/1e/bd/sun-going-down-at-the.jpg",,

Now I understand why people retire here!  The vibe, the waves the Aloha Lifestyle...hard to explain in a review.  The waves were pounding, a couple of surfers were shredding, the white sand was so smooth and the wind was calming down the heat.  Found a nice shade between Rock Piles Beach and Banzai Pipeline Beach and stayed there for hours.  I might seriously change my retirement plans.  Cost of living is high, but now I understand why.
