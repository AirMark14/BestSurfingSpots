It is a beautiful beach with great surf most of the time! There are a couple different points along Trestles (besides Lower). See the picture I posted that lists the different beaches. From North to South here are the breaks: Cottons, Uppers, Lowers, Middles, Churches. The picture I posted lists the experience level needed for each spot.

I love how it takes a little bit to get down to this spot. Makes it more exclusive for locals and surfers, and harder for tourists to come down! The beach is usually never crowded, which is awesome, unless there is a contest - which attracts more people.

It is also a good beach to exercise at besides surfing. I like to walk/run the beach/trail and I see people biking the trail as well.

Lower Trestles has been described as ""one-and-a-half miles of God's country"" for a reason. There are no parking lots or coastal view restaurants at this surf spot. Just you, the railroad tracks, sand and ocean. Trestles makes you feel like you've discovered a hidden gem (if you can ignore the other 50 surfers fighting for waves).

Prepare yourself for perfectly formed long lefts and rights that'll have you happy you made the 15-minute walk down the dirt trail with your gear. You won't find this spot on streaming video with a swell update (locals are tough!) but it'll make the highlight reel of and home video or competition clip. There is an annual event held here once a year by the ASP, otherwise you'll just find locals tearing it up.

Trestles is a crowded spot from trying to find parking at the Carl's Jr. to the sets. With the rest of the breaks around like Uppers, Cotton's, Church you still find yourself avoiding rails on the drop.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/trestles-beach-san-clemente,Trestles Beach,5,"After buying some new Rainbow Sandals after many years, I decided to finally find the infamous trestles beach to go surfing.  Now for some 411.

Parking:
There is no parking lot next to the beach.  You are about half a mile away and have two options

1) State Parking Lot
3965 S El Camino Real, San Clemente, CA 92672

The first option is to park at the state lot near Carls Jr.  If you have a CA State Parking pass it will work here.  Otherwise there is a kiosk for $2/hour or $15/day

2) Street
South of the parking lot along El Camino Real and Cristianitos is street parking if you can nab some.

Getting there:
You have two walking routes:
See

https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zlPIZnZsgPFs.klHKhdfMWCQQ

1) From El Camino Real there is an opening where you can walk down into the trail.  You will walk down from a hill where you hit a fork.  You can turn right, go straight, or turn left.  You want to keep going straight, pass the restrooms, and pass the trestles map.  Keep walking and when you see train tracks, go UNDER them and you can access the beach

2) You can walk down Cristianitos Road, and then turn a left after the 5.  When you hit a fork in the road make a right and follow the same directions from above.

Some people skate or bike down to the trail.

Amenities:
+ There are no rinse off areas
+ There is a restroom by the trail leading in

What to bring:
+ Your surfboard bag
+ Water
+ Towel

Most people there just put there stuff on the beach and then head into the water.",,03/10/2015 00:11:28,1425946288,pio1-B1rKcTauJMzBmo6sg,Dan Q.,300,167,384,"Garden Grove, CA",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/qQSBY1-kWxDhz5Wi3gKIdA/180s.jpg,FrS6_FIv4MZitd6MO7THMQ,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=FrS6_FIv4MZitd6MO7THMQ,,,,,,12,0,2,0

How to get there on foot:

Park by the Carls Jr/Hwy 5 overpass. It's free to park on the street but there's a paid lot too (I think it was $5)
Don't change into your wetsuit because you'll be walking a mile (some of it hilly) in it. 
Start by going through the opening in the fence, and you'll be walking on a gravely dirt road toward the ocean (go right)
The rest is pretty self explanatory - just follow the path, and you'll reach train tracks that are raised. GO UNDER THE TRACKS for your own safety.

Right where you pop out to the beach is UPPER TRESTLES.  If you walk south 10 more minutes there's LOWER TRESTLES.

Change into your wetsuit and surf on!

We actually surfed Church Beach which is between San Onofre and Lower Trestles.  Parking here is restricted to Military and Government Employees and fortunately we have that covered in our Surf Club/Team.    The beach itself was very clean as would be expected.  We arrived at about 7am and found only about 10 other surfers in the water.  Throughout the morning it grew to about 30 surfers.  Still the lineup was friendly, polite, and enjoying themselves.  

The conditions were very nice, and consistent sets of 3-5 foot waves were common.  Surfers should be warned though, entry and exit from the beach is challenging due to the large rocky area for about 25 meters from the shore to the open water.  Bring and wear booties for sure here.  Also dogs must be on a leash in the camping area only.  Apparently, the fine is $500 for violation of this rule/law.  Also, the beach access is slightly changed, look online for how to enter the private camping/parking area at Church Beach, as in the past you could access from the Camp Pendleton, San Onofre Gate entrance only, but due to construction, you now follow the same entrance to San Onofre State Beach and then break off to the right and enter Camp Pendleton.",,04/07/2014 19:07:52,1396897672,x2QgUYJuDDuTmgzbEQWuMQ,Christopher C.,325,1367,848,"Sacramento, CA",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/-NaE3fvOY4RRvANzIYcOVg/180s.jpg,jc3jhh2iQ1dPnT7rPI5xvg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jc3jhh2iQ1dPnT7rPI5xvg,,,,,,12,0,11,0

Then there's about a half mile walk over the freeway, through the jungle, and over the train tracks. Along the way, you'll see threatening looking signs scribbled on the path ""Speak english"", ""Go back"", ""RIP"" and various lude symbols. The path has rusted out barbed wire on either side.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/trestles-beach-san-clemente,Trestles Beach,4,"I've traveled around the world looking for a wave like Trestles, but there really is only one Lower Trestles. That being said, it's almost always insanely crowded. Even if this exact wave were located in Iceland, I think it'd be crowded...it's just a perfect A-frame that is super consistent, super forgiving. 

On a decent swell, the waves around trestles have this strange magic quality...something about the cobblestones, water texture and color, brings it all together. The crowds in the water kind of make it more stressful than it should be, but if you're patient and know what you're doing, you'll get some waves. Due to the competitiveness in the water, it's not a place for beginners (just walk to San O, it's a short walk down the beach and one of the world's greatest beginner zones).

It seems like surfers have kept this beach pretty clean. I guess the long walk, lack of facilities, and cobblestone beaches keep the non-surfing population low. 

I think every few years Trestles will be threatened with toll road proposals, developments, etc., but I think it'll weather all these storms. It'd be tragic if it were any less preserved.",,07/05/2013 09:30:04,1373016604,_OO3yFxS1v1iImncK3dB-g,G Y.,48,0,9,"Palo Alto, CA",,1g41TQjy3Kll3dpFbfsBVw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1g41TQjy3Kll3dpFbfsBVw,,,,,,1,0,1,0
https://www.yelp.com/biz/trestles-beach-san-clemente,Trestles Beach,5,"one of VERY few world class waves in california and therefore among the most crowded waves in the continuous united states. on a good day expect upwards of 100 bros in the lineup, with at least 20 mouth breathers scratching like hell to catch every set wave. 

the lefts are punchier but the rights are a thing of beauty. if ever a wave was shaped like a video game skate park, lowers is it. navigate the drop, drive thru your bottom turn, hit the lip, and pump/punt/float/slash all the way down the line.

8/27/10 will go down as an all time session in my book. i caught three consecutive set waves that felt like they connected all the way to middles.

Despite the heavy foot traffic and popularity, it is pretty clean and well maintained.  Been here several times in the past few months, and so far all of the patrons here have been friendly and I've never had any trouble.  I take my metal detector down and get a lot of curious folks talking to me about it.  Haven't been at night yet, but it seems like there's a good nightlife.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/trestles-beach-san-clemente,Trestles Beach,5,"dude this place is so rad - its such an epic wave and the best thing about it is that nobody really surfs here. its kind strange how such a perfect wave can be right off the freeway yet be so empty all the time, even when everywhere else is flat this place will be 1 - 2 foot and ripable, but totally empty, and its funny cause when there is some good south running the crowd at this place really thins out, I think its becuse its so hollow and you really have to know how to ride the tube in order to surf here, also its super hard to film here so most the pros are just over it when there is swell running. overall though even on the rare day when the crowd becomes a problem you will find that most guys are in the water are really forgiving and will make sure that everyone is getting their share of waves without being wave hogs themselves. this is one of those rare spots that is such a good wave but really encompasses everything that surfing is and should be, its all about respect out here and brotherhood and its really about man, board and wave, a truely soulful type of surf spot. honestly dont worry about this place, you should just roll down with your homies and paddle out. score it easy and then go to carls jr for healthy after surf grinds.",,06/19/2011 03:34:15,1308454455,dVEEN7p-fhQ69G_CzODmcQ,Shaka B.,12,60,116,"Huntington Beach, CA",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/FtSEYMB85TEk2Rl4_C3JVA/180s.jpg,RODUc87UULC1p67gAeR1xw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RODUc87UULC1p67gAeR1xw,,,,,,0,0,5,0
