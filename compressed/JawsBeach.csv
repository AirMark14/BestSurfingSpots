No lie with best cap driver take us there.,"This place was the best beach in Bahamas! The water was so calm and blue and not too many people here. It was so great we came twice! We were staying at the Warwick Hotel, and to get here it was 40 minutes away. They called a taxi for us, and the taxi driver was so good to us. Now what made this cab driver so nice was he made multiple stops and stood with us. He even watched our stuff for us. We did pay him an extra $5 per person for him to stay with us the entire time but it was worth it! Not only did he drive us but also gave us a little tour around the island showing us different sights and told us about the history, and even took pictures for us on the beach.
