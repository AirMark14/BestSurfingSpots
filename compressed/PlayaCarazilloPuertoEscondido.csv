My husband and I like to arrive by 9AM and lay in the sun on a towel on the beach for a little while and then rent chairs under the shade. It's a fun place to swim. Great people watching too as by 11AM-ish it starts to get pretty busy. Lots of families in the shallow water laughing and having a great time. Rental chairs are comfortable and a nice break from the sun. Excellent half day.,Written 13 March 2024,1710288000,HLSHWS,5,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/9f/68/3e/caption.jpg,,

The people working at the restaurants there are not very happy with the people that go there, kinda rude. I asked for price on two lounge chairs and umbrella, 400 pesos. I keeps walking to check out other prices and on the way I bought a coconut from another vendor. I went back to the original place to get the lounge chairs since that was the best price. The guys working there glared at us with darting eyes and said “no you can’t sit here any more because you bought something from another place.” Really you’re gonna turn down $400 pesos because I spent $70 on a coconuts? Ridiculous. Over all it’s okay, if it’s on your way check it out but otherwise you’re not missing much.",Written 2 March 2024,1709337600,Katherine S,2,,,

The surfing vibe is the worst I've ever seen - 50+ people out there all the time and people telling you to leave. Don't come here to surf because if you're not a local, and not Mexican, they will treat you poorly you and tell you to leave.
