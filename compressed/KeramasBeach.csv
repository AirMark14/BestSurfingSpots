There are kilometres and kilometres of them.  Many are very easy to reach and one is Keramas beach about half an hours taxi drive from Kuta.  My wife and I will come back and stay at the nearest resort/hotel next time.  This is a wonderful Balinese beach to visit and see black sand.  It has its own beauty.,Written 13 April 2014,1397347200,Wayne S,5,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/b7/92/fe/keramas-beach.jpg,,

Unfortunately we are not surfer and weren't aware that the beach is not good for swimming so we couldn't use it. We walked some tours and dined at Timor Kitchen (very recommendable) and the Swan Restaurant (nice place).
