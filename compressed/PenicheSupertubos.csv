The swell comes from deeper sections of the ocean and builds up fast and steep just of the beach. However if it is not too big, the wave is great fun to ride even for my level. And of course it has the worldcup. This is a surfers beach and I would not recommend swimming here as the currents can be very strong. A friend got pulled in the rip current once - she was only rescued by the lifeguards.",Written 18 October 2016,1476748800,Jonathan F,5,,,

My wife and daughter went for a walk down by the sea, where it was cooler.<br />Whilst me and my son went off in the sand dunes, where he enjoyed rolling around in the sand, and running up and down the dunes.<br />This activity didn't last too long though, lol<br />",Written 28 August 2016,1472342400,Jamie C,5,"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/bc/32/bb/photo1jpg.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/bc/32/ba/photo0jpg.jpg",,

A fantastically clean beach with just enough waves for a decent surf, without being to intimidating for a swim. Appeared to be mostly locals, lots of bohemian and surf types hanging out here. Lovely dunes for shelter and a long expanse of uncluttered golden sand. One of my favourite beaches along the silvercoast so far.",Written 24 July 2016,1469318400,Chloe S,5,"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/35/a2/dd/supertubos-beach.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/35/a2/d9/supertubos-beach.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/35/a2/cd/supertubos-beach.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/35/a2/c1/supertubos-beach.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/35/a2/ad/supertubos-beach.jpg",,

The surf is top notch. There's tons of space on the sand to set up, but bring your own umbrella as they don't rent any out. It's DOG FRIENDLY, which is wonderful if you're looking for a place to take your fury friend. For those of you who don't have dog, don't worry, the dogs can't swim in the designated swim area.<br /><br />I would suggest visiting the Banana Beach Bar for food and drinks. They're snacks are delicious and the vibe is laid-back and fun. They're not on tripadvisor so you'll have to walk around to find them.
