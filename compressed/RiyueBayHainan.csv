We went to the original (Surfing Hainan/Jalenboo/Riyue Bay Surf Club). They rent boogie boards and surf boards and provide lessons.

Had initially planned a longer stay but wind/waves/current was too strong due to offshore typhoon so left early since literally nothing else to do or eat when not surfing. the only hotel here did not have wifi in room and i couldn't watch TV either bc it was blurry and only 6 channels all in chinese. <br /><br />so the beach is like any typical beach youll find in australia or america. nothing to write home about but it was uncrowded which was nice. they are building some resort with large cranes over the ocean when i was there so that did kill the scenic beach vibe for me and it is really big so you can see it when youre sitting in the line up or really anytime you look over the horizon out to see, so that was minus. <br /><br />the main left break is a far paddle out and definitely tiring when the swells are pumping. you also need to watch out for the reefs as they are all over and under where the main surf breaks. i wore my hard bottom reef shoes and would recommend same for you unless you are experienced surfing shallow reef breaks (i do not, having mainly surfed in california where we dont have many reef breaks). soft bottom booties wouldnt protect you as these reefs felt pretty hard. first day there, i bumped into a local kid that got the underside of his foot torn up bc he was surfing barefoot. many locals do it tho but they are very experienced with this break and surfing over this particular reef. also if you are a taller surfer then the more reason to wear hard reef shoes. <br /><br />now the wave... best part, its uncrowded, just handful of locals and beginners usually. unless its pumping and/or overhead, i suspect this wave is more fattish and mellow other than the first section where it hits the shallow reef and throws a bit but then immediately mellows out some with fattish shoulder to play with so overall seems like a fun wave but i only really surfed it once and it was 3-5ft that day. you can def use a funboard or longboard here even when its pumping. they host longboard contests yearly here past couple years i think. shortboard would also work but it is a long paddle out and looked like too much work unless surf is at least 4/5 ft. fish would prob be lot of fun at 3-4ft. <br /><br />PRO: good break for more experienced surfers to practice, esp reg footers like myself can work on backhand. the wave seems rippable and is not overly fast with open face available for vertical surfing. would not recommend for beginners bc of the reef. also, the local surf shop is great and super friendly with decent selection of boards for rent. book hotel room through surf shop for better rates or stay at their hostel if solo. <br /><br />CON: reef all over and long paddle out; nothing else to do or anywhere else to go when not surfing; lack of food options; lack of public transportation (need to cab it to and from train station)<br /><br />Overall: if you are here just to surf and you want to surf in china specifically, unless the swells conditions happen to be ideal when you're here, i prob wouldnt come down here just for the swell, in part, bc the other amentiies and infrastructure around the area are really lacking (and you need a wetsuit during the prime season, i.e. winter). if you havent surf traveled much then you can try riyuewan but if you have ever surfed in hawaii, taiwan, california, costa rica, or australia (esp australia which has the best and most consistent glassy surf ive ever surfed) then you may be disappointed unless you time your riyuewan just right to match the right swells (in which case, some great surf sessions can thep trump the fact that there is nothing else to do nearby)",Written 7 January 2017,1483747200,Beijing_Realist,3,,,

Still the surf lesson I got from the guys at surfinghainan.com was pretty good. And people spoke English there and are friendly and helpful. 100 RMB to hire a board. The village itself offers some roadside shops for tourist needs but nothing fancy, it's all very worn down and basic. No ATM, no Family Mart, no pharmacy, no... Don't expect any kind of European comfort. Difficult to find shadow to just sit on the beach. Beach not 100% clean but we've seen worse on Hainan. Water is nice. There's a public bus which we did not use, looks adventurous but without Chinese language skill I guess arranging a car service is the way to get here.

Although everyone in China rushes to Sanya, with their lake like still waters, Riyue allows you to experience a more raw, natural, authentic experience. Facilities are scarce, since it's more a place for Chinese tour groups that stop to eat and take pictures, but don't get wet. So, you have only 4 restaurants, and 3 options for sleeping. During summer the waters are calm and you can go snorkeling. From November to March, it is mostly good for surfing. The beach is calm and clean, compared to other places.

The beach has more size and power but while I was there very square with no banks to form peaks, its was just 50m shore break close outs. One day a few guys on boards were out playing it.

I cut my trip short because of this.<br /><br />A little difficult to get to unless you pay top dollar for a taxi otherwise get to Wanning and try for a bus that will take about 40-60min and could be packed with locals and school kids. Unless you are serious for a surf I would't bother as there is almost nothing else going on here. There's a large shed structure in which you'll find a surf shop (Surfing Hainan) with a surprising selection of boards to rent, and a basic restaurant that specialises in local seafood for day tripper groups of Chinese.

At one end of the beach there are some statues for the tourists to pose by. At the other end there is a rocky granite reef. I saw two men snorkeling there and there were sea urchins and crabs around. Half way along the beach there is a surf club where there is a bar and you can hire surf boards. I was there with a school group and we hired some instructors to teach us to surf. The waves were not enormous, but were great for beginners like ourselves.The water was beautiful to be in. Overall the beach was not particularly crowded, except in the late afternoons when tour buses would roll in for a short time.

Although everyone in China rushes to Sanya, with their lake like still waters, Riyue allows you to experience a more raw, natural, authentic experience. Facilities are scarce, since it's more a place for Chinese tour groups that stop to eat and take pictures, but don't get wet. So, you have only 4 restaurants, and 3 options for sleeping. During summer the waters are calm and you can go snorkeling. From November to March, it is mostly good for surfing. The beach is calm and clean, compared to other places. There were two camels roaming.<br />We go as a family, the kids love it.
